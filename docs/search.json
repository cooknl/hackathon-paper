    "text": "5.1 Explore\nExplore data infrastructure options. Data infrastructure is a prerequisite for working with data. Monica Rogati, among others, made a comparison with Maslow’s hierarchy of needs (Maslow 1943) and created “The Data Science Hierarchy of Needs” (Rogati 2017), depicted as a triangle or pyramid, Figure 1. Collection, movement, and storage are at the base of the pyramid. This representation is chronological, following the flow of data from source to working location, followed by techniques to explore, understand, and organize, before generating algorithms and models for inference, prediction, and influencing decisions.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The Data Science Hierarchy of Needs\n\n\nThe exact sequence, though, is not essential for the bottom two layers. The basic components of infrastructure are:\n\nStore (sometimes called “data at rest”)\nCompute\nTransport (sometimes called “data in motion”)\n\nA Data Hackathon directly stresses all three components, by design. Your organization may have been considering adding or modifying aspects of each infrastructure component. The hackathon is an opportunity to put these updates in action and uncover pain points that would remain invisible without direct application of focused effort. The hacker teams may use the components in ways that were not anticipated by the originators, as well.\n\nAFTC Data Hackathon Infrastructure\nThe AFTC Data Hackathon made use of infrastructure already existing and available to DAF members, but which may not be used to their full potential. To date, the primary platforms used, in chronological order:\n\nDAF CDAO “VAULT” providing access to:\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) compute and Simple Storage Service (S3) store in the cloud\nDatabricks notebooks running Python and R orchestrated with Apache Spark\nHue SQL assistant\nApache Zeppelin notebooks running Python orchestrated with Apache Spark\nPlotly Dash dashboard front ends with Python visualizations\n\nMicrosoft 365 including:\n\nMicrosoft Azure compute and store in the cloud\nExcel\nTeams\nSharePoint\nPower Automate\nPower Apps\nPower BI\n\nDAF CDAO “Envision” providing access to:\n\nAWS EC2 and S3\nPalantir Foundry\nPython and R scripting\nData Application Programming Interfaces\n\n\nTo the maximum extent, the hacker teams used government-furnished equipment (GFE), including computers, network connections, and virtual private networks, to ensure any outcomes of the event could be implemented within the significant constraints of the DAF network environment."

    "text": "5.2 Expose\nExpose “data hackers” to your organization’s test and management data. Data silos, also known as information silos, are widely acknowledged as detrimental to organizational health, as evidenced by a quick web search for \"data silos\" OR \"information silos\". The disadvantages are many, including:\n\nDuplication of data, because everyone feels as if they need a local copy, or out of simple ignorance of the existence of the data elsewhere in the organization; results in loss of configuration management and authoritative sources\nLack of diversity, because no fresh eyes see the data, no new ideas or different perspectives can be heard; results in stagnation of process and thinking\nIncreased friction, because even the simplest data requests must be manually handled, sometimes literally so, making processes vulnerable to single points of failure if an individual is sick, on travel, or on leave; results in increased frustration and decreased efficiency and effectiveness\n\nFigure 2 shows a conceptual example of duplicated information in different teams of the same organization, with no connections between them (http://factory.dev n.d.). Such an organization would conceivably suffer from all of the disadvantages above.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Examples of data silos with duplicated information and no connections\n\n\nEven without doing the heavy lifting of breaking down data silos and forging the infrastructure, policy, tooling, and more required for a sustainable solution, a Data Hackathon can:\n\nidentify and highlight duplication\nbring in diversity of experience, skill, and even culture\nreduce friction by creating interpersonal connections and building trust across the organization\n\n\nAFTC Data Hackathon exposure to data\nTeam formation for hackathons, or even the choice between individual hackers or a team approach, can vary according to the objectives of the event. One of the explicit objectives of the AFTC Data Hackathon is to discover latent organic talent. The AFTC Data Hackathon organizers operate on the assumption that there exists latent talent within AFTC and sister organizations, defined as people who:\n\nare already highly skilled, but have not been tasked with data-centric activities in the course of their primary duties\nare looking for ways to increase their data-centric skills, and even to make a career “pivot” away from their current role and into a more data-centric career field\nare “data-curious” and interested in exploring data-centric activities, but have not been prepared or able to fully commit to pursuing building the skill set, which can be expensive in time, money, and attention, whether directly or via opportunity cost.\n\nThe AFTC Data Hackathon is also focused on discovering and developing organic talent, defined as:\n\nMilitary - active-duty, Reserve, or Guard military members\nCivilian - United States Department of Defense (US DoD) civil service employees\nContractor - DoD support contractors, and to a lesser extent “prime” contractors who represent the original equipment manufacturers of systems acquired by the DoD\n\nThe AFTC Data Hackathon is not focused on commercial sources of talent during the event, and the event is not used as a way to assess commercial offerings not already available to AFTC. Proofs-of-concept or prototypes developed by organic talent during the event may lend themselves to commercial support to bring capabilities to production and daily use, but this path is not assumed a priori."

    "section": "5.3 Evolve",
    "text": "5.3 Evolve\nEvolve third-party and in-house scripts and apps to solve real-world problems. Evolution, as opposed to “creatio ex nihilo” creating something from nothing, implies some existing capability that is then brought to bear to provide a solution. Evolution has many advantages for a Data Hackathon:\n\nbuilding on an existing foundation of code and tooling\nencouraging reuse or remixing of existing capabilities (Creative Commons n.d.)\nincreasing the likelihood of an “out-of-the-box” solution that requires minimum installation or configuration when put into production\n\nReal-world problems likewise have several advantages:\n\nA built-in value proposition - the problem owner has an existing pain point, little additional justification is required\nAn existing dataset - typically the problem is centered on the use of an existing dataset, reducing the need for “synthetic data” to emulate the use case (Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems 2020) or deriving “notional” or “toy” problems that may not generalize well\nAvailable domain knowledge - the problem owner has subject matter expertise to guide and clarify which approaches are best suited to the domain\n\n\nAFTC Data Hackathon evolution of scripts and apps to solve real-world problems\nExpected products resulting from a hackathon are major dimension of variation. Some hackathons sole purpose is to create clean-sheet design and implementation of a desktop, phone, or cloud application. Some hackathons use a single problem as a means to compare different teams’ performance. Some hackathons use toy problems to avoid complications that inevitably arise from using real-world problems, such as privacy, ill-prepared datasets, operations security, and many others. The AFTC Data Hackathon products vary by problem, but stand-alone application development is rarely required. Two of the three explicit objectives of the AFTC Data Hackathon are represented here.\nTo drive progress of contemporary data technologies, the organizers make the hacker teams aware of the available infrastructure mentioned above in Section 5.1.1. Teams are highly encouraged to make use available frameworks, packages, and environments, working on GFE equipment and networks.\nTo solve real AFTC problems, the organizers advertise and solicit problem statements from across the Center. To date, multiple problems have been selected for each event. These vary widely in both their disciplines and their tool sets, providing a diverse offering for a diverse set of hackers. A problem owner is identified as the primary contact for any teams addressing their problem, providing domain knowledge. The problem owner provides the dataset, along with information about data sources and desired data products."

    "section": "5.4 Expand",
    "text": "5.4 Expand\nExpand awareness of the state of the art digital technologies within your organization. No change is possible without action, but action without knowledge, understanding, and wisdom is futile. A popular US Air Force (USAF) pejorative is “all thrust, no vector,” typically directed at junior personnel who are highly energetic, but not necessarily focused on a particular objective. Awareness is the beginning of knowledge, understanding, and wisdom. To jumpstart your organization’s digital transformation, its personnel must know what options are at their disposal to solve their own problems.\nA Data Hackathon can provide a venue for showcasing data options. Thus far, this paper has focused on the organizers, problem owners, and hacker teams. If these are the only personnel aware of the state of the art digital technologies within your organization, change will be limited. To increase the breadth of awareness, several other populations can be directly involved in the event or can be otherwise engaged.\nMost directly, hacker team members need their supervisors’ approval for participation. Hackathons are by definition significant and concentrated investments of time and attention, requiring prioritization above other tasks. In the approval process, the supervisors should be provided with an explanation of the objectives and methods for the event, including the technologies used.\nDirect involvement can also come in the form of a senior leader judge’s panel. Judges are introduced to the problem sets, which brings the problems’ existence to their attention. It should never be taken for granted that senior leaders are aware of such problems. Judges are also briefed on the teams’ solutions, including the technologies used and remaining technology or policy gaps.\nOther engagement can include broad advertisement of and invitations to:\n\nevent existence and registration\nsolution presentations\njudging results and prizes\n\nSuch notices should include direct references to technologies available, thus expanding awareness to peers and other leadership.\n\nAFTC expansion of awareness\nAFTC consists of the Arnold Engineering Development Complex, the 412th Test Wing, and the 96th Test Wing, headquartered in central Tennessee, southern California, and northwest Florida, respectively. Each of these comprises several groups and divisions, and many squadrons, offices, and other units, many of which are located at bases and facilities not geographically coincident with their headquarters. Thanks to collaboration software, primarily Microsoft Teams, other communication channels, enterprise file sharing services, and cloud computing resources, data hackers can participate from any location.\nBy drawing on these diverse and distributed data hackers, the AFTC Data Hackathon supervisor approval directly reaches many units across the Center. Senior leader judges are primarily drawn from Center, Wing, and Complex levels, and sometimes from the Group and Division level. Conscious effort is made for broad representation among the judge’s panel, to include officer, enlisted, and civil service leadership.\nAdvertisement and invitations are broadly distributed through command channels, direct announcement among cross-cutting data working groups, basewide bulletins, innovation channels, public affairs articles, social media such as LinkedIn and Twitter, among others."

A variety of backgrounds contribute to a diverse team, as seen in Figure 4 in the Appendix.\nProblem Owner: Primary point of contact to Data Hackathon personnel in general, and to the hacker teams working a solution in particular, for problem definition and associated datasets. Attends problem definition and scoping meetings. Assists in creating communication content, including a “short title” to help uniquely identify the problem. Creates a pre-recorded problem introduction briefing for use by data hackers as they choose a problem to work during team formation, and for use by judges to educate the judges panel on the value proposition and context for the teams’ solutions. Identifies an alternate problem owner. Work to operationalize the proof-of-concept or prototype generated during the event.\nJudge: Receives solution presentation briefings, asks questions to clarify the solution and its impact, applies rubric to award prizes.\nDirector: Provides overall vision for the event. Sets event calendar. Determines event objectives. Ensures roles are filled and personnel are trained.\nLead Software Officer: Guarantees the mission impact of the event and responsible for guiding solutions from proof-of-concept or prototype created during the event to operationalization and beyond.\nEvent Site Lead: Broad project officer skill set. Manages operations and logistics support for their site. (One per site)\nSolution Development Support: Data science team leadership skill set. Work alongside hackers during the event and guide them through the process of working collaboratively in a team of developers. The solution development support position contributes to the “flavor” of all solutions during the event. (One per site)\nMission/Data Solution Integration Lead: Data officers in-training. Gain experience leading problem owners in the translation of a mission problem into a data problem which is well-scoped for the event. They will gain a breadth of understanding in the field of data science and data engineering sufficient to help others scope problems or extrapolate solutions from the current state of possible.\nAlternate Problem Owner: Alternate point of contact if problem owner is unavailable to support definition, solution, and operationalization."

    "text": "6.3 Problem Definition Process\nProblems arrive in several ways, but once identified, there are several steps required to prepare the problem prior to the event. These steps typically occur during one or more appointments. Having at least two event organizers present allows one to serve as “scribe” to document the discussion and the other(s) to focus on the interaction.\n\nHackathon Introduction\n\nDesired Outcomes:\n\nDetermine if the problem is appropriate for the scope and outcomes of the Data Hackathon.\nDetermine mutual interest in moving forward.\nIf moving forward, identify a primary problem owner.\n\nAssume no prior knowledge, understanding, or experience with a Data Hackathon. Describe the broad objectives of the event and what a problem owner can expect as an outcome.\nAsk for a general overview of the problem.\nExplicitly ask if the problem owner is interested in submitting their problem to the event.\nExplicitly state an assessment of the suitability of the problem for the event.\n\nProblem Definition\n\nDesired Outcomes:\n\nDefine the problem as a data problem.\nCreate a “persona” describing a typical user of the solution (Cooper 2021).\nIdentify relevant data sources.\nIdentify desired or required solution properties.\nIdentify any constraints on hacker team methods.\nCreate a problem “short title” as a unique identifier for the event.\n\nAssuming no prior knowledge, understanding, or experience with the problem, have the problem owner dive deeply into the problem.\nIf possible, have the problem owner demonstrate the dataset and as many process steps as practical.\nReflectively listen, clarifying domain-specific terms, aka “jargon.”\nSketch a problem diagram, preferably in a manner visible to all participants, to provide a concrete basis for discussion.\n\nProblem Scoping\n\nDesired Outcomes:\n\nScope the problem statement and desired outcomes appropriately to the time and resource constraints of the event.\nCreate an “elevator pitch,” a succinct summary of the problem statement, constraints, and desired outcome.\n\nThe result of this scoping serves as a contract of sorts, establishing expectations, so be explicit as possible.\n\nProblem Introduction\n\nDesired Outcome: A prerecorded video providing the problem statement, the motivation for the solution, and any other pertinent information"

    "text": "7.1 Team Formation\nWith a geographically distributed and potentially hybrid (on-premises and remote) event, forming teams is always a challenge, because individual hackers may not know each other, and communicating preferences is difficult. Ad hoc team formation has been sufficient, but more effective methods of getting an initial team lineup are being investigated, including combining individual problem preference ranking with linear programming to ensure minimum and maximum team size constraints can be set, as well as maximum coverage over the available problems. Such an initial lineup would be considered an “80% solution” and final team rosters would be determined after a period of freedom to move between teams.\nTeam formation has been done the morning of Day 1 for the first three iterations of the AFTC Data Hackathon, but to smooth the process, and to allow more time for actual hacking, a better time may be the week prior, with last minute changes the morning of Day 1."

Combined with a scoring rubric that could be more broadly interpreted than intended, this has led to some of the judging questions and breakout discussions focused on aspects of the problems and solutions that were beyond the scope of the event.\nUpdates to the rubric should be done after each event, and orientation of the judges to the rubric should be accomplished as early as practical. For the next event, we are considering having the judges watch all the problem introduction videos the week prior, then assigning one or two problems to each judge for them to have a focused meeting with the problem owner, to better understand the problem, as well as the value proposition offered by the event and the teams’ solutions. During deliberations, the judges can then help the rest of the panel better understand the context of their focused problem."

    "text": "7.3 Transition from Prototype to Production\nOperationalization of the AFTC Data Hackathon solutions has not been automatic. While two of the three explicit objectives are met even if the problem solutions never enter regular use, problem owners are best served when they can make use of the tools and techniques delivered by the hacker teams.\nHopefully, adding more explicit post-event actions will help with the transition. Additionally, having the problem owner’s unit provide at least one hacker working on their problem has been helpful for some teams.\nWe expect this challenge to continue in the future, as hackathon product transitions are typically a struggle (“Hackathon:Criticism” 2022). However, by working closely with problem owners and updating the approach every iteration, we hope to improve the prototype survival rate."
