# Abstract

The United States Department of the Air Force's (DAF's) Air Force Test Center (AFTC) completed its third iteration of the AFTC Data Hackathon in August of 2022. "Hackathons" are low risk, high return investments that can jumpstart your test organization's digital transformation. Hackathons for software engineering have existed for more than two decades in the disciplines of cryptography, web development, and apps.  With the advent of data science, big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, "Data Hackathons" bring the hackathon model to these data-centric disciplines. A Data Hackathon allows your organization to: explore data infrastructure options, expose "data hackers" to your organization's test and management data, evolve third-party and in-house scripts and apps to solve real-world problems, and expand awareness of the state of the art digital technologies within your organization. The future of test will require ever increasing data volume, variety, and velocity. The pace of improvement in tools and techniques will continue to accelerate. Data Hackathons can focus your test teams and provide momentum for your organization's digital transformation.

# Introduction

The United States Department of the Air Force's (DAF's) Air Force Test Center (AFTC) completed its third iteration of the AFTC Data Hackathon in August of 2022. "Hackathons" are low risk, high return investments that can jumpstart your test organization's digital transformation. Hackathons for software engineering have existed for more than two decades in the disciplines of cryptography, web development, and apps.  With the advent of data science, big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, "Data Hackathons" bring the hackathon model to these data-centric disciplines.

This paper will explain the benefits of implementing a Data Hackathon in your flight test organization. In addition, a framework for planning, provisioning, executing, and following up on a Data Hackathon is provided, which can then be modified as required to meet the opportunities and constraints of your organization.

# Benefits

A Data Hackathon allows your organization to: 

- explore data infrastructure options, 
- expose "data hackers" to your organization's test and management data, 
- evolve third-party and in-house scripts and apps to solve real-world problems, and 
- expand awareness of the state of the art digital technologies within your organization.

## Explore

**Explore data infrastructure options.** Data infrastructure is a prerequisite for working with data. Monica Rogati, among others, made a comparison with Maslow's hierarchy of needs [@http://zotero.org/users/7103471/items/8FKVC28U] and created "The Data Science Hierarchy of Needs" [@http://zotero.org/users/7103471/items/4LGMVBAM], depicted as a triangle or pyramid.

The basic components of infrastructure are:
